ObjType:%

ObjType represents the style of function being tested.

If ObjType is 0 (or None), it is a function. This is like 'units.js' with the modified export.
The call looks like:
    functionName(input)

If ObjType is 1, it is a function returning an object. This is like 'languages.js', 'times.js'.
The call looks like:
    functionName().input

If ObjType is 2, it is a pure object. This is like 'levels.js'.
The call looks like:
    functionName.input
