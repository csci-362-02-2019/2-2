please see the files within testCases Executables:

tests for the function mmolToMgdl
    test group 1 is invalid inputs. 
    Since the function has poor error handling, and fails on the first and most basic of such tests,
    there is only one test case.

        test case 1 is located within the test-units.js file under the first 'context'
        it tests the function mmolToMgdl when given an invalid input

    test group 2 is valid integer inputs.

        test case 2 is located within the same file under the second 'context'
        it tests the function mmolToMgdl when given a valid input of 1

        test case 3 is located within the same file under the second 'context'
        it tests the function mmolToMgdl when given a valid input of 2

    test group 3 is valid non-integer inputs.
    these tests are to ensure that floats are accepted correctly, and that rounding is done predictably.

        test case 4 is located within the same file under the second 'context'
        it tests the function mmolToMgdl when given a valid input of 2.5

        test case 5 is located within the same file under the second 'context'
        it tests the function mmolToMgdl when given a valid input of 1.145

        test case 6 is located within the same file under the second 'context'
        it tests the function mmolToMgdl when given a valid input of 1.06

tests for the function mgdlToMMOL
    tests are extremely similar

possible future tests:
    tests for invalid inputs after improving the error handling of the function
    tests for further valid input ranges (int max, float max, negatives)
    tests comparing the results between the two functions (does converting the result return the original value?)
