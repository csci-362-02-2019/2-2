Test ID:
    units_test_16

Requirements being tested:
    reversibility of conversion functions (lack of rounding errors) when given float inputs

Component being tested:
    units.js

Method being tested:
    mgdlToMMOL(mmoltoMgdl())

Function:
    mmolToMgdl converts an mmol measurement to Mgdl
    mgdlToMMOL converts an MGDL measurement to mmol
    both are called to ensure that they work well together
    mmoltoMgdl(mgdlToMMOL(val)) should == val

Input:
    21.3

Expected output:
    21
